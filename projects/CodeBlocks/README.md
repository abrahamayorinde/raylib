# Raylib template for Code::Blocks

1. Install Raylib.  On Windows you must install the 'Windows Installer (with MinGW compiler)' package.  On other
platforms you can install however you like.

2. Windows only: In Code::Blocks, select `Settings` `Compiler` `Toolchain executables`.
Change `Compiler's instrallation directory` to `C:\raylib\MingGW`.  Do *not* press auto-detect.  There is a screenshot 
below showing how it should look.  Press `OK`.

3. Select `File` `Open` and open the `core_basic_windows.cbp` file.
