roadmap
-------

Current version of raylib is quite complete and functional but there is still a lot of things I would like to improve.
Here it is a list of features I would like to add and functions to improve.

Around the source code there are multiple TODO points with pending revisions/bugs and here it is a list of desired features.

raylib v1.4

   [DONE] TTF fonts support (using stb_truetype)
   [DONE] Raycast system for 3D picking (including collisions detection)
   [DONE] Floyd-Steinberg dithering on 16bit image format conversion
   [DONE] Basic image manipulation functions (crop, resize, draw...)
   [DONE] Storage load/save data functionality
   [DONE] Physics module
   [IN PROGRESS] LUA scripting support (wrapper to lua lib)
   - Remove GLEW dependency (use another solution... glad?)
   - Basic image procedural generation (spot, gradient, noise...)
   - Basic GPU stats sytem (memory, draws, time...)
   
   
Check [GITHUB ISSUES][issues] for further details on implementation status for this features!
